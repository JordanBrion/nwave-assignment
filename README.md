# NWAVE - Technical Task for Developers

This project can be used within a Python virtual environment
> pipenv shell

## HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
> python main.py

## HOW TO RUN THE TESTS
> python -m unittest

## POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS
- disk XML is not correct for position and color (tags have the same name)
- pretty print the XML and JSON
- put each test case in its own file
- remove the test cases from the main API
- don't hardcode viewport dimensions => pass them via ctor
